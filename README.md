# Easy Peasy Tracker

Welcome to CB1140's dissertation project, Easy Peasy Tracker. A sweet and easy lifestyle tracker to help healthcare visits be less daunting. 

## Abstract

This document entails a healthcare-centred webpage application development plan and journey. The main issues it aims to solve is the growing awareness of Cyberchondria in society, and the suffering decline of healthcare service support in the UK. It aims do this by designing an application that can be used in order to relate data from a patient to their doctor without the need for regular appointments, in which the doctor can access the data through their application. 

In this document, comparative reviews of existing services and investigations into user needs are carried out in order to support and design a suitable prototype of an application. Itâ€™s software lifestyle follows the Waterfall methodology, with an originally Kanban-styled application development plan that supported the initial groundwork to the project. The end application is a lifestyle application that allows users to track intakes such as water, their personal information as well as symptoms of ailments they currently suffer from. Using local storage, cookies and JSON data, it stores their data locally to surpass a need for a traditional log-in system. Users can then request their data in order to either import their profile on another device, or to take to their General Practitioner.
